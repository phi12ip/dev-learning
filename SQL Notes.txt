tblUser - stores information in a table structure

vwUser - combined table information just for viewing

procUser.save - actionable tasks to perform on tables


tblUser
idUser | username | firstname | lastname | order
	1	  jsparks	Josh		Sparks	 	1
	2	  jsparks2	Josh		Sparks	 	2
	3	  jspark4s	Josh		Sparks	 	4
	4	  jspark3s	Josh		Sparks	 	5

Query is any SQL you are executing:
ex: 
select * from tblUser	

pull all columns from tblUser

you can specify specific columns through
select idUser from tblUser

This pulls specifically this one column from tblUser.
This pulls information faster than *.

----------------------------------------

To add data to a table you would use:

insert into tblUser (username, firstname, lastname, order)
values ('jsparks','Josh','Sparks','6')

note missing idUser because that is a "identity column" that was set when the table was created and you do not insert indentity columns they are set automatically.
Also note single quotes! (do not use double quotes.)

to insert multiple you would do:

insert into tblUser (username, firstname, lastname, order)
values ('jsparks45','Josh','Sparks','7'),
('jsparks46','Josh','Sparks','8')

to insert from another table:

insert into tblUser  (username, firstname, lastname, order)
select username, firstname, lastname, order from tblUserPhils
where idUser > 2


----------------------------------------

if we want to merge data from two tables, we find a common element and link the two tables together.
meaning: 



tblUser
idUser | username | firstname | lastname | order
	1	  jsparks	Josh		Sparks	 	1
	2	  jsparks2	Josh		Sparks	 	2
	

tblUserProperties
idUser | address 		| city 		| state | zip
	1	  913 Shore		Arnold			MD	21012
	2	  TestLoc		Pasadena		MD	21122
	
select * tblUser U 
left join tblUserProperties UP on U.idUser = UP.idUser

will output:
idUser | username | firstname | lastname | order | idUser | address 		| city 		| state | zip
	1	  jsparks	Josh		Sparks	 	1		1	  913 Shore		Arnold				MD	21012
	2	  jsparks2	Josh		Sparks	 	2		2	  TestLoc		Pasadena			MD	21122
	
	
----------------------------------------

if you didnt want to write out all of those select / joins you would use a view.
A view you cannot insert into you cant have it execute code, it is just for looking at data that has been merged together.


there is built in code for creating view

Create view vwUser
{

select * form tjvasmfkladsk
where ajskldalksjdamlsd

}

select * from vwUser
where idUser > 5

----------------------------------------

stored procedures.

They are executed using 
exec user.save

user.save is the procedure name.

Procedures perform actionable events.

you pass in parameters to procedures after the exec user.save,
ex:

EXEC SelectAllCustomers City = "London", PostalCode = "WA1 1DP"
